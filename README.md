# Chirona

## Overview

Current SARS-Cov-2 variants and lineages are identified by PANGOLIN.

Emerging variants show resistance against vaccines previously produced, with neutralising effects.

Chirona attempts to find hotspots of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Pango lineages and generate permutations of sequences that can adapt to said mutations.
